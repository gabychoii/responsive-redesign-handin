                        Zara is the first website that came to mind when thinking about a website with accessibility issues.
                         Numerous word-of-mouth encounters and personal experiences as a user of this website has 
                        made me aware of the common consensus that this website is difficult to navigate.

                        Notes: On first glance, the Zara website is admittedly “aesthetically pleasing”, in the sense that it seemingly 
                        resembles an editorial fashion magazine. However, in the digital website format, this design choice 
                        results in an poorly organized website and un-intuitive customer experience. As visible in the above 
                        screenshots, this begins with the home page, which does a poor job of emphasizing the site elements users 
                        should be interacting with - the table below describes several issues pertaining to the usability of Zara’s website:

                    <table id="table">

                            <td>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Unless the user changes the website format to visually filter products side-by-side (second option), there are no names or information describing each product. This makes it difficult to identify the exact clothing item being sold and later search for products by name.</li>
                                    <li>On the product pages, there are no buttons to scroll between the images for each item. Users must intentionally swipe to scroll between images. Additionally, only some products have multiple images - this makes it difficult to perform traditional online shopping tasks such as easily looking at items from multiple angles.</li>
                                    <li>You cannot filter by more than one object category at a time.</li>
                                    <li>(Figure 3) The filtering categories are located at the top of the page. These categories disappear when a user scrolls down, and reappear when a user scrolls back up. Additionally, the filters scroll without a solid background bar, and often blend in with the pictures of clothing.</li>

                                </ul>
                            </td>

                            <td>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Home page: The large, moving images distract from the navigation bar at the top of the page, oftentimes even obstructing the (already very thin) text with matching background and text colors (e.g., screenshot 1, top right corner).</li>
                                    <li>Since the text is directly on the background image (with no surrounding box/shadow) it is not made clear that a user is supposed to click on the text to access the website’s navigation menu.</li>
                                    <li>If a user does correctly utilize the floating text to navigate to the pop-up navigation menu, they’ll likely notice that the available categories of product are not intuitively organized, nor do they seem to be in any particular order. E.g., “Woman”’s menu has 30 separate categories, sorted by clothing type, material, line, and even has a Home section - they are all listed with no visual point of differentiation.</li>
                                    <li>Product Page: These buttons have a box surrounding them (unlike the home page), but there is not a clear indication of the purpose of each button (some open filters, some automatically filter). A user can change the orientation in which objects are laid out, but there is no text indicating this function.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </td>

                                    <li>
                                        Over time, this website has maintained the same general structure - however, Zara follows a “fast fashion” product cycle, and will change the navigation menu categories to reflect this, leading to a lack of consistency in category organization which can make it difficult to look for specific products.

                Overall, as can be seen above, the process of redesign highlighted the dynamic 
                nature of the design process. From my brainstorming stage (sketches) to my final 
                prototype, there is an evident change in certain design choices and the reasoning
                behind these changes. These changes were the result of observing the interfaces of 
                other websites, and developing an understanding of the difference between accessibility
                and pure "aesthetic" in website design. It was very interesting trying to brainstorm
                how to bring accessibility to the Zara website while maintaining Zara's brand, which 
                is one of the crucial factors to its business model. I really enjoyed this process, and 
                am now noticing patterns and design choices that I interact with on a daily basis!
